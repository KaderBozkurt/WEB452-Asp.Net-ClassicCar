I decided on a creative website about selling classic cars with ASP.NET MVC.
This website should contain classic car sales information.
It should also include a list of classic cars for sale.
There should be pictures of these cars on the homepage, and clicking these pictures will take you to a list with customer reviews.

LET'S START!
Visual Studio 2019 and Asp.Net MVC are used for this website.
Initialize Default ASP.NET MVC Assignment
Create New Project/individual/HTTPS
Create Repository named WEB452-Asp.Net-ClassicCar/send first commit.
My project has been created.
First I override the "sslPort":4444 line in the Properties/launchSettinggs.json file.
I have attached the README.txt application.
I tested the app.
second;
Add Application Controller/Car.cs
Add App View/Car/Index.cshtml(First we create a file named Car in the view, then right click on this file and add index.cshtml with add/new item)
Change title and date in _Layout.cshtml
Added logo to _Layout.cshtml and change font family and size.
